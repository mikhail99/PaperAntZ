Introduction:**\n\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being applied to mathematical tasks, exhibiting surprising proficiency in problem-solving, symbolic computation, and proof generation. However, these capabilities are largely based on pattern recognition and statistical mimicry, rather than genuine mathematical understanding. A critical knowledge gap remains: we lack a systematic understanding of *how* LLMs represent and manipulate mathematical concepts internally, and the subsequent impact on their performance across diverse mathematical domains. This research aims to address this gap by investigating the internal representation of mathematical knowledge within LLMs.\n\n**2. Research Questions:**\n\nThis research will address the following key questions:\n\n*   How do LLMs represent mathematical concepts (e.g., numbers, equations, theorems) internally?\n*   What are the dominant mechanisms by which LLMs manipulate these representations during mathematical tasks?\n*   Does the internal representation of mathematical concepts influence the accuracy, robustness, and efficiency of LLM performance across different mathematical domains (algebra, calculus, number theory, geometry)?\n*   Are there systematic correlations between specific internal representations (e.g., activation patterns, embedding spaces) and observed errors in LLM outputs?\n\n**3. Methodology:**\n\nThis research will employ a mixed-methods approach, combining quantitative and qualitative techniques:\n\n*   **Probing Tasks:** We will design a suite of probing tasks specifically tailored to elicit information about LLM’s internal mathematical representations. These tasks will range in difficulty and will target different mathematical concepts.\n*   **Representation Extraction:** We will utilize techniques like activation analysis and embedding space visualization to extract and analyze the internal representations learned by LLMs. We will focus on identifying patterns and structures within these representations.\n*   **Comparative Analysis:** We will conduct a comparative analysis across multiple LLMs (GPT-3, PaLM, LLaMA) to assess the variability in internal representations and their impact on performance.\n*   **Dataset Utilization:** We will leverage publicly available datasets such as Project Euler and other mathematical problem sets to evaluate LLM performance under controlled conditions.\n*   **Error Analysis:** A crucial component will be a detailed error analysis, correlating observed errors in LLM outputs with specific internal representations. This will involve examining activation patterns, embedding spaces, and other internal features.\n\n**4. Timeline:**\n\n*   **Phase 1 (Months 1-3):** Literature review, task design, dataset preparation, initial LLM experimentation.\n*   **Phase 2 (Months 4-9):** Probing task implementation, representation extraction, comparative analysis across LLMs.\n*   **Phase 3 (Months 10-12):** Detailed error analysis, report writing, dissemination of findings.\n\n**5. Expected Outcomes:**\n\nThis research is expected to:\n\n*   Provide a deeper understanding of how LLMs represent mathematical concepts internally.\n*   Identify key factors influencing LLM performance in mathematical tasks.\n*   Generate insights that can be used to improve the design and training of LLMs for mathematical applications.\n*   Contribute to the broader field of AI and mathematical reasoning.\n\n**6. Resources Required:**\n\n*   Access to multiple LLMs (API access, cloud computing resources).\n*   Computational resources for data processing and analysis.\n*   Software tools for data visualization and statistical analysis.",

      "justification": "This research proposal demonstrates a high degree of novelty and potential contribution to the field of LLM-based mathematical reasoning. The core question – how LLMs *actually* represent mathematical concepts – is a significant gap in current understanding. The proposed mixed-methods approach, combining probing tasks, representation extraction, and comparative analysis across multiple LLMs, is well-suited to address this question. The use of diverse mathematical domains (algebra, calculus, number theory) and publicly available datasets like Project Euler adds to the rigor. The inclusion of error analysis, specifically correlating errors with internal representations, is a crucial element that elevates the proposal's potential.  The focus on architectural differences across LLMs (GPT-3, PaLM, LLaMA) represents a valuable comparative element. While the timeline is reasonable, the emphasis on detailed error analysis and representation extraction suggests a deep dive into the technical aspects, which is a strong indicator of a novel and impactful contribution.  A minor deduction (reducing the score slightly) is made because the proposal doesn't explicitly address potential biases within the datasets or the challenges of interpreting complex activation patterns. However, the overall approach is highly promising and warrants significant attention."

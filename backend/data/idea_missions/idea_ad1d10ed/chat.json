    "content": "### Objectives\n1. Explore integration of RNNs (Recurrent Neural Networks) with diffusion models for sequence generation or temporal modeling.  \n2. Investigate synergies between RNNs (for sequential dependencies) and diffusion models (for probabilistic generation).  \n\n### Assumptions\n- The user has foundational knowledge of RNNs and diffusion models.  \n- The goal is to apply this combination in domains like NLP, time-series prediction, or generative tasks.  \n- Computational resources are sufficient for training complex models.  \n\n### Approach\n1. **Literature Review**: Analyze existing work on RNNs and diffusion models.  \n2. **Architecture Design**: Propose a hybrid model (e.g., RNN-based prior for diffusion models).  \n3. **Experimentation**: Train models on sequence datasets (e.g., text, speech).  \n4. **Evaluation**: Compare performance metrics (e.g., perplexity, FID) against baseline models.  \n\n### Milestones\n- Week 1–2: Literature review and problem definition.  \n- Week 3–4: Design and implement hybrid model.  \n- Week 5–6: Training and validation.  \n- Week 7: Results analysis and reporting.  \n\n### Risks\n- **Technical Challenges**: Stability of diffusion training with RNNs.  \n- **Computational Cost**: High resource demands for training.  \n- **Performance Limits**: Limited improvement over existing models.  \n\n### Deliverables\n1. Hybrid model architecture diagram.  \n2. Training logs and evaluation metrics.  \n3. Comparative analysis report.  \n4. Code repository for reproducibility.",

Introduction:**\n\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being applied to mathematical tasks, exhibiting surprising proficiency in problem-solving, symbolic computation, and proof generation. However, these capabilities are largely based on pattern matching and statistical correlations, rather than genuine mathematical understanding. A critical knowledge gap remains: we lack a systematic understanding of *how* LLMs represent and manipulate mathematical concepts internally, and the subsequent impact on their performance across diverse mathematical domains. This research aims to address this gap by investigating the internal representations utilized by LLMs when tackling mathematical problems.\n\n**2. Research Questions:**\n\nThis research will address the following key questions:\n\n*   How do LLMs represent mathematical concepts (e.g., numbers, equations, theorems) internally?\n*   What specific mechanisms (e.g., attention patterns, activation patterns, embedding spaces) are utilized to encode and process mathematical information?\n*   Does the internal representation of a mathematical concept influence the LLM’s ability to solve problems or generate proofs within that domain?\n*   Are there systematic correlations between specific internal representations and the types of errors made by LLMs?\n\n**3. Methodology:**\n\nThis research will employ a mixed-methods approach, combining quantitative and qualitative techniques:\n\n*   **Probing Tasks:** We will design a suite of probing tasks across various mathematical domains (e.g., algebra, calculus, number theory) to assess the LLM’s understanding of specific mathematical concepts. These tasks will be carefully crafted to elicit information about the LLM’s internal representations.\n*   **Representation Extraction Techniques:** We will utilize activation analysis and attention visualization techniques to examine the internal states of the LLMs during problem-solving. This will involve analyzing the activation patterns of neurons and the flow of attention across different layers.\n*   **Comparative Analysis:** We will conduct a comparative analysis across multiple LLMs (e.g., GPT-3, PaLM, LLaMA) to identify architectural differences and their potential impact on internal representations.\n*   **Error Analysis:** We will meticulously analyze the errors made by the LLMs, correlating these errors with specific internal representations. This will involve identifying patterns in the errors and relating them to the LLM’s internal encoding of the mathematical problem.\n*   **Dataset:** We will utilize publicly available mathematical datasets, including problem sets from platforms like Project Euler and datasets specifically designed for LLM evaluation.\n\n**4. Timeline:**\n\n*   **Month 1-3:** Literature review, dataset preparation, development of probing tasks.\n*   **Month 4-6:** Implementation of representation extraction techniques and comparative analysis across selected LLMs.\n*   **Month 7-9:** Detailed error analysis and correlation with internal representations.\n*   **Month 10-12:** Report writing and dissemination of findings.\n\n**5. Expected Outcomes:**\n\nThis research is expected to:\n\n*   Provide a detailed understanding of how LLMs represent mathematical concepts internally.\n*   Identify key mechanisms that influence LLM performance in mathematical tasks.\n*   Generate insights into the limitations of current LLMs in mathematical reasoning.\n*   Contribute to the development of more robust and reliable LLMs for mathematical applications.",

      "justification": "This research proposal demonstrates a high degree of novelty and significant potential contribution to the field of LLM understanding and mathematical reasoning. The core question – how LLMs *actually* represent mathematical concepts – is a critical gap in current knowledge. The proposed mixed-methods approach, combining probing tasks, representation extraction techniques (activation analysis, attention visualization), and comparative analysis across different LLMs, is exceptionally well-designed to address this question. The inclusion of error analysis, specifically correlating errors with internal representations, is a particularly strong element, promising to reveal valuable insights. The proposal’s scope is ambitious yet focused, and the timeline appears realistic. The emphasis on comparative analysis across multiple LLMs adds substantial value, acknowledging the architectural differences that likely play a role in representation. While the research is complex, the potential for a transformative contribution to our understanding of LLMs' mathematical capabilities is very high. The proposal clearly articulates a rigorous and innovative approach, deserving of strong support."

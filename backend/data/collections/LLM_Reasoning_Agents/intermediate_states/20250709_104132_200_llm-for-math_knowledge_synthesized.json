    "synthesized_summary": "Recent research explores the application of Large Language Models (LLMs) to mathematical tasks, including problem-solving, symbolic computation, and proof generation. While LLMs demonstrate some ability to mimic mathematical processes, significant challenges remain in ensuring accuracy, robustness, and genuine understanding. Current efforts focus on error analysis and improving the LLMs' capacity for mathematical reasoning. However, a critical knowledge gap persists: a systematic understanding of *how* LLMs represent and manipulate mathematical concepts internally, and the resulting impact on their performance across diverse mathematical domains.",
    "knowledge_gap": "There is a lack of understanding of the internal representation of mathematical concepts within LLMs and how this representation affects their mathematical reasoning abilities.",

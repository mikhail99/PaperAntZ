Introduction:**\n\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly employed for mathematical tasks, exhibiting surprising proficiency in problem-solving, symbolic computation, and proof generation. However, their performance remains inconsistent and prone to errors, suggesting a fundamental gap in our understanding of *how* these models actually represent and manipulate mathematical concepts internally. This research aims to systematically investigate this critical knowledge gap, providing insights into the internal representation of mathematical knowledge within LLMs and its impact on their reasoning abilities.\n\n**2. Research Questions:**\n\nThis research will address the following key questions:\n\n*   **RQ1:** What internal representations do LLMs utilize when processing mathematical problems? (e.g., symbolic structures, numerical approximations, probabilistic models)\n*   **RQ2:** How do these internal representations vary across different LLMs (e.g., GPT-3, PaLM, LLaMA)?\n*   **RQ3:** What correlations exist between specific internal representations and the types of errors LLMs produce?\n*   **RQ4:** Can targeted interventions in the LLM’s internal representation improve its mathematical reasoning performance?\n\n**3. Methodology:**\n\nThis research will employ a mixed-methods approach, combining quantitative and qualitative techniques:\n\n*   **Probing Tasks:** We will design a suite of probing tasks specifically tailored to elicit information about the LLMs’ internal representations. These tasks will range in difficulty and will target different mathematical domains (e.g., arithmetic, algebra, calculus).\n*   **Representation Extraction:** We will utilize techniques like activation analysis and attention visualization to extract information about the internal representations utilized by the LLMs during problem-solving.\n*   **Comparative Analysis:** We will conduct a comparative analysis across multiple LLMs (GPT-3, PaLM, LLaMA) to identify differences in their internal representations and their impact on performance.\n*   **Error Analysis:** A detailed error analysis will be performed, categorizing errors based on their potential root causes (e.g., incorrect symbolic manipulation, flawed logical reasoning, numerical instability).\n*   **Intervention Experiments:** We will explore targeted interventions, such as fine-tuning specific layers or introducing constraints on the LLM’s internal representations, to assess their impact on performance.\n\n**4. Datasets:**\n\n*   **Project Euler:** A collection of challenging mathematical problems, providing a robust benchmark for evaluating LLM performance.\n*   **MATH Dataset:** A large-scale dataset of mathematical problems and solutions.\n*   **Custom-Designed Probing Tasks:**  Tasks specifically designed to probe the LLMs’ understanding of mathematical concepts.\n\n**5. Timeline:**\n\n*   **Month 1-3:** Literature review, task design, dataset preparation.\n*   **Month 4-6:** Probing task execution and data collection across selected LLMs.\n*   **Month 7-9:** Representation extraction and error analysis.\n*   **Month 10-12:** Intervention experiments and final report writing.\n\n**6. Expected Outcomes:**\n\nThis research is expected to:\n\n*   Provide a systematic understanding of the internal representation of mathematical concepts within LLMs.\n*   Identify key factors contributing to errors in LLM-based mathematical reasoning.\n*   Inform the design of more robust and reliable LLMs for mathematical applications.\n*   Contribute to a deeper understanding of the relationship between AI and mathematical reasoning.",

      "justification": "This research proposal demonstrates a high degree of novelty and significant potential contribution to the field. The core question – how LLMs *actually* represent mathematical knowledge – is a critical and largely unexplored area. The proposed mixed-methods approach, combining probing tasks, representation extraction, and comparative analysis across multiple LLMs, is exceptionally well-designed to tackle this challenge. The focus on identifying correlations between internal representations and errors is particularly insightful and likely to yield valuable results. The use of established datasets like Project Euler adds a strong grounding in practical evaluation. While the timeline is ambitious, the scope of the research and the potential impact justify the effort. The proposal clearly articulates a novel approach to understanding a fundamental limitation of current LLMs, and the anticipated outcomes – a deeper understanding of internal representations and improved LLM design – represent a substantial contribution. The inclusion of multiple LLMs ensures a robust and comparative analysis, increasing the likelihood of uncovering truly novel insights. The proposal’s focus on error analysis is a key differentiator, moving beyond simple performance metrics to investigate the underlying mechanisms driving LLM behavior. Overall, this is a highly innovative and promising research proposal with the potential to significantly advance our understanding of AI and mathematical reasoning."

Introduction:**\n\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being applied to mathematical tasks, exhibiting surprising proficiency in areas like problem-solving and symbolic computation. However, their performance remains inconsistent and reliant on pattern matching rather than genuine mathematical understanding. A critical gap exists in our understanding of *how* LLMs internally represent and manipulate mathematical concepts. This research aims to systematically investigate this internal representation and its impact on mathematical reasoning across diverse domains.\n\n**2. Research Questions:**\n\nThis research will address the following key questions:\n\n*   **Representation Mechanisms:** What specific internal representations (e.g., vector embeddings, graph structures, symbolic representations) do LLMs utilize to encode mathematical concepts like numbers, equations, and geometric shapes?\n*   **Domain Specificity:** How does the internal representation of mathematical concepts vary across different domains (e.g., algebra, calculus, geometry, number theory)?\n*   **Impact on Reasoning:**  To what extent does the chosen internal representation influence the LLM’s ability to solve problems, generate proofs, and perform symbolic computations?\n*   **Error Analysis:** What types of errors do LLMs make, and how are these errors correlated with the specific internal representation being employed?\n\n**3. Methodology:**\n\nThis research will employ a mixed-methods approach:\n\n*   **Probing Tasks:** We will design a suite of probing tasks specifically designed to elicit information about the LLM’s internal representations. These tasks will include:\n    *   **Concept Identification:** Tasks requiring the LLM to identify mathematical concepts from textual descriptions.\n    *   **Equation Completion:** Tasks where the LLM must complete partially defined equations.\n    *   **Proof Generation:** Tasks where the LLM attempts to generate mathematical proofs.\n*   **Representation Extraction:** We will utilize techniques like activation analysis, attention visualization, and probing layers to extract information about the LLM’s internal activations and representations.\n*   **Comparative Analysis:** We will compare the performance of different LLMs (e.g., GPT-3, PaLM, LLaMA) on the same probing tasks to assess the influence of architectural differences on internal representation.\n*   **Error Analysis:** A detailed analysis of the errors made by the LLMs, categorized by type and correlated with the identified internal representations.\n\n**4. Expected Outcomes:**\n\n*   A detailed characterization of the internal mathematical representations utilized by LLMs.\n*   Identification of the factors that influence the choice of internal representation.\n*   A framework for understanding the relationship between internal representation and mathematical reasoning performance.\n*   Recommendations for improving the robustness and accuracy of LLMs in mathematical applications.\n\n**5. Timeline (Estimated):**\n\n*   Phase 1 (3 months): Literature review, task design, LLM selection.\n*   Phase 2 (6 months): Experimentation, data collection, representation extraction.\n*   Phase 3 (3 months): Data analysis, report writing, dissemination.\n\n**6. Resources Required:**\n\n*   Access to LLMs (API access or model deployment).\n*   Computational resources (GPU access).\n*   Software libraries for data analysis and visualization.",
